# The Weather Dataset


     The Weather Dataset is a time-series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location.
     It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and Conditions.
     This data is available as a CSV file. We are going to analyze this data set using the Pandas DataFrame.
